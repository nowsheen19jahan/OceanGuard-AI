# OceanGuard-AI
AI-powered underwater monitoring system that detects debris and algae using YOLOv8 and provides a water pollution severity score.

---

## Project Overview
OceanGuard-AI automatically detects underwater debris and algae to assess water quality.  
It provides:

- Detection of plastics, nets, bottles, and algae  
- Pollution severity scoring: Low, Moderate, High, Critical  
- Annotated images with bounding boxes  
- Analytical tables with counts, confidence, and impact  
- Interactive map of analyzed sites

## Internship Information
This project is developed as part of the **Shell–Edunet Skills4Future AICTE Internship**, organized by **Edunet Foundation** in collaboration with **AICTE** and **Shell**.  
The internship focuses on building **Green Skills through Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, empowering students to create innovative and sustainable solutions for real-world environmental challenges.

## Problem Statement
Water pollution and underwater debris are major environmental concerns affecting marine ecosystems and human health.  
Manual inspection and chemical testing are slow, resource-intensive, and cannot scale efficiently.  
There is a need for an **AI-driven, image-based system** that can detect underwater debris and algae automatically, providing real-time insights into water quality.

---

## Project Proposal
The goal is to develop an **AI-based system** using **YOLOv8** to detect and classify underwater debris and algae, providing actionable ecological insights:

- Plastic waste (bottles, bags, nets, etc.)  
- Algae species  
- Hazardous or polluted water conditions  

The system is integrated into a **Streamlit web app**, allowing users to:

- Upload underwater images  
- Get instant detection results with **bounding boxes**  
- Receive a **pollution/severity index**  
- Visualize monitored sites on an interactive map  

---

## Progress
- YOLOv8 models for underwater debris and algae detection are trained and ready.  
- Streamlit app is implemented for image upload, detection visualization, and pollution index calculation.  
- Sidebar controls allow setting detection mode, confidence threshold, and IoU threshold.  
- Analytical tables summarize counts, confidence, and impact of detected objects.  
- Interactive map visualizes multiple monitoring sites and pollution levels.  

---

## Future Enhancements
- Improve algae detection accuracy and coverage.  
- Integrate multiple sample sites for aggregated pollution reporting.  
- Enhance visualization of pollution hotspots on interactive maps.
